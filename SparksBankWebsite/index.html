            <h4>Brief Description of Spark Foundation.</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
              The Sparks Foundation. This brand new education nonprofit trying to sell students hope for successful future. Hope that they can rise out of any situation, regardless of where they came from. Whether it’s from a family with a less than ideal financial situation or a family that simply does not support where they want to go. Either way, The Sparks Foundation (or TSF) is for you. This brand new startup was co-founded by people who believe that every student should have a chance at greatness, and they have created multiple programs to help students reach their maximum potential.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The first program that they have successfully put into play for about three months now is their Graduate Rotational Internship Program, or GRIP. This internship program is based completely online as a part-time internship for students to complete in the span of 3 months. GRIP offers internships for the areas of tech, marketing, and human resources. The first month works on individual tasks, such as writing articles and designing posters, the second month consists of group work. The groups for the second month of the program are based on a personality test that all interns take at the beginning of the program so that all interns are placed into groups that will complement their strengths and weaknesses. The last month focuses on expanding the interns’ knowledge of the area they are working in. This program has been successfully running for a few months now, and TSF is expanding their programs to include a wider variety of students from a variety of different backgrounds.</p>
            </blockquote>
             This upcoming September TSF will be sponsoring workshops with SINDA(Singapore Indian Development Association) in five different schools. These talks will be focused on soft skills such as flexibility, conflict resolution, and time management. These talks are vital because schools tend to not focus on developing these skills, instead, they rely on the students to learn them as they get older. These skills are vital for success in both their school life and their personal lives. TSF aims to improve not only the education aspect of their school experience but also the personal aspect as well. It is in ways like this that TSF aspires to inspire young people to reach out to achieve their maximum potential both in their educational and personal lives. TSF wants to ensure that all students have the skills to achieve anything they set their minds to, and if they need an extra step to achieve that, TSF has got them covered. </p>
